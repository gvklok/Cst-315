# Virtual Memory Management Shell

This shell implements virtual memory management to extend the memory available for processes to run. It includes mechanisms for launching and handling processes, memory allocation, page tables, and page frames. Before starting, review the following concepts:

1. **Memory allocation**
2. **Virtual addresses**
3. **Page tables**
4. **Page frames**

## Features

- **ANSI color codes**: Color-coded output for better readability.
- **Memory management structures**: Implements page tables and frame tables.
- **Process management**: Allocates memory for processes and handles page faults.
- **Signal handling**: Handles SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals for graceful termination.

## Usage

Compile the program and run it from the command line. You can provide a batch file as an argument to execute multiple commands, or run in interactive mode to enter commands manually.

## Compilation

Compile the program using a C compiler:

```sh
gcc -o shell shell.c
```

## Execution

Run the compiled program:

```sh
./shell [batch_file]
```

- Replace `[batch_file]` with the path to a batch file containing commands, or omit it for interactive mode.

## Examples

Interactive mode:

```sh
./shell
```

Batch file execution:

```sh
./shell batch.txt
```
